# Soda: The Data Quality and Reliability Platform

---

## Overview

Soda is an end-to-end data quality and reliability platform engineered for modern data teams. Its primary function is to enable organizations to systematically monitor, manage, and resolve data issues across the entire data lifecycle, from ingestion to consumption.

By providing a unified framework, Soda empowers data producers and consumers to detect, analyze, and triage data quality incidents, thereby minimizing "data downtime" and fostering a culture of data trust.

The platform is comprised of three core, integrated components:

*   **Soda Library & CLI:** A Python-based library and command-line interface that executes data quality scans against a wide range of data sources. It serves as the core engine for running checks.
*   **SodaCL (Soda Checks Language):** A declarative, human-readable language for defining data quality tests. Written in YAML, SodaCL allows teams to manage their data quality rules as code, enabling version control, reusability, and collaboration.
*   **Soda Cloud:** A centralized web platform that provides observability into data health. It is used for monitoring check results over time, visualizing metrics, configuring alerts, and managing the entire lifecycle of a data quality incident.

## Core Capabilities

Soda provides a comprehensive suite of features designed to ensure data integrity and reliability at scale.

*   **Declarative, Test-as-Code Approach:** Define sophisticated data quality checks using SodaCL. This approach allows tests to be version-controlled, peer-reviewed, and integrated directly into your development workflows, treating data quality with the same rigor as application code.

*   **Proactive Data Contracts:** Implement and enforce Data Contracts directly within your CI/CD pipeline. By verifying data against a predefined schema and quality standards *before* it is published, Soda prevents bad data from entering your ecosystem, shifting quality assurance from a reactive to a proactive discipline.

*   **Comprehensive Monitoring and Observability:** Go beyond simple validation. Track data quality metrics over time, automatically detect anomalies in your data patterns using machine learning, and monitor for unexpected schema changes. Soda Cloud provides a centralized dashboard for complete data health observability.

*   **Collaborative Incident Management:** When a data quality check fails, Soda Cloud automatically creates a trackable "Incident." This allows teams to assign ownership, discuss root causes, and manage the resolution process in a structured and collaborative environment, integrated with tools like Slack, MS Teams, and Jira.

*   **Broad Connectivity and Integration:** Soda seamlessly integrates with the modern data stack. Connect to dozens of data sources, from traditional SQL databases to cloud data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift. Push alerts and incidents to your existing communication and ticketing systems.
