### ❓ What is Soda?

**Soda** is an open-source and commercial data quality platform designed to help teams monitor, validate, and improve the quality of their data throughout the data lifecycle. It allows organizations to define data quality checks and contracts, automate data validation, and integrate with modern data stacks—from traditional databases to cloud data warehouses and data lakes.

Soda's main goal is to ensure that data remains **trustworthy, complete, and usable**—especially in dynamic and large-scale environments like analytics pipelines, real-time systems, and IoT platforms.

###  Key Features:

* **Data Validation & Monitoring**: Define rules to check for anomalies, missing values, freshness, duplicates, and schema changes.
* **Data Contracts**: Formal agreements between producers and consumers about data expectations (schema, values, freshness, etc.).
* **Automation & CI/CD Integration**: Run data checks in development, staging, or production pipelines.
* **Integration with Data Sources**: Supports databases like PostgreSQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, and more.
* **Soda Core & Soda Cloud**:
    * **Soda Core**: A CLI-based, open-source framework for running data checks.
    * **Soda Cloud**: An optional cloud-based platform for collaboration, alerting, and dashboards.

###  Why it Matters:

In today’s data-driven environments, especially with IoT systems generating high-volume data, maintaining data quality is essential. Soda provides the tools to **automatically catch issues** before they impact downstream applications, ensuring data reliability and trust at scale.
