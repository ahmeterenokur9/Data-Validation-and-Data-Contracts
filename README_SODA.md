## What is Soda?

Soda is a comprehensive data quality and reliability platform designed to help teams prevent "data downtime." It's a tool that connects directly to your data sources (like Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL, etc.) and allows you to run checks to ensure your data is always **fresh, accurate, complete, and valid.**

It's more than just a testing library; it's a complete ecosystem that includes:

*   **Soda Library:** A powerful Python library and CLI tool to define and run data quality checks.
*   **SodaCL:** A human-readable, domain-specific language (DSL) for writing data quality rules in simple YAML files.
*   **Soda Cloud:** A web-based platform for collaborating with your team, monitoring results over time, managing incidents, and getting alerts when bad data is detected.

Soda empowers everyone on the data team‚Äîengineers, analysts, and scientists‚Äîto have confidence in the data they use every day.

## Why Use Soda?

If you've ever had a dashboard break because of bad data, wasted hours debugging a data pipeline, or had stakeholders lose trust in your reports, Soda is for you. It helps you:

*   ‚úÖ **Prevent Data Incidents:** Catch data quality issues *before* they impact your downstream dashboards, ML models, or business operations.
*   ü§ù **Build Trust in Data:** Create a single source of truth for data health. When data is certified by Soda, everyone can trust it.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Automate Your Checks:** Stop writing repetitive and hard-to-maintain SQL queries or Python scripts. Define clear, declarative rules with SodaCL and let Soda handle the execution.
*   ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Shift-Left with Data Contracts:** Implement Data Contracts to ensure data is correct *at the source*. Enforce quality standards directly in your CI/CD pipeline, preventing bad data from ever being published.
*   üöÄ **Collaborate Effectively:** Provide a common language (SodaCL) and platform (Soda Cloud) for engineers and business users to define what "good data" means and resolve issues together.
