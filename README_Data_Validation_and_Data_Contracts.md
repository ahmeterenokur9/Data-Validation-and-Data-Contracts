# 1. Data Validation

## 1.1. What is Data Validation?

Data validation is the process of checking whether the information entering a dataset is in the **“expected format, complete, and consistent.”** This process covers a series of rules, such as data types (number, text, date), value ranges (e.g., temperature between –40 and +125 °C), detection of null or duplicate records, and the completeness of mandatory fields.

## 1.2. Why is it Important?

* **Reliability:** Incorrect or incomplete data can distort analysis results, leading to false alarms or erroneous reports.
* **Data Quality:** Clean and validated data minimizes the margin of error in subsequent processes like machine learning, reporting, and alert systems.
* **Cost-Effectiveness:** Fixing problems caused by faulty data at later stages can lead to high costs and time loss. Early-stage validation mitigates this risk.

## 1.3. What is its Relationship with IoT?

* **Continuous Data Stream:** IoT devices (sensors, meters, monitoring modules) generate high-volume, real-time data. This data can be corrupted due to network disconnections, sensor calibration errors, or hardware failures.
* **Real-Time Decision Support:** In critical systems like emergency response (e.g., fire alarms, level meters), incorrect data can lead to missed critical actions.
* **Edge vs. Cloud Validation:** In IoT architecture, validation can be performed at the device level (**edge**) or in the cloud layer. Edge validation is crucial for scenarios requiring low bandwidth and low latency.

# 2. Data Contracts

## 2.1. What are Data Contracts?

Data contracts are agreements between data **producers** and data **consumers** that define mutually accepted data schemas, formats, and quality rules. Much like an API contract, this document specifies how data will be provided, what fields it will contain, and what checks will be performed on it.

## 2.2. Why are they Important?

* **Guaranteed Compatibility:** Prevents integration errors arising from data incompatibilities between different teams or systems.
* **Versioning and Backward Compatibility:** Schema updates are managed in a controlled manner. Older consumers can ignore new fields, and mandatory field changes are communicated through notifications.
* **Ownership and Accountability:** Clarifies which team is responsible for which data field and who to contact for support in case of an error.

## 2.3. What is their Relationship with IoT?

* **Distributed Architecture:** In IoT systems, hundreds or thousands of different devices and services share data. A data contract organizes this complexity and strengthens system integration.
* **Evolving Device Firmware:** Field devices receive firmware updates over time. When new sensors are added, the data contract centrally defines the changes.
* **Automated Validation:** Edge gateways or cloud pipelines can automatically evaluate incoming data against the data contract. In case of a violation, mechanisms like alerts, rollbacks, or re-transmissions can be triggered.
