## About The Project

In the world of the Internet of Things (IoT), data quality is paramount. Sensor networks can produce vast amounts of data, but this data is often prone to errors, inconsistencies, or malformations. Processing this unreliable data can lead to incorrect analytics, system failures, and poor decision-making.

This project addresses this challenge by providing a robust, end-to-end solution for validating and monitoring MQTT data streams in real-time. It acts as a central gatekeeper that intercepts data from various topics, validates it against dynamically configurable rules, and then re-publishes it to designated "validated" or "failed" topics. This clean separation ensures that downstream applications only receive high-quality, reliable data.

The entire system is managed through a powerful web-based Admin Panel, allowing users to add, remove, or modify topic mappings and validation schemas on the fly, without ever needing to restart the core service manually. Coupled with a full observability stack using Prometheus, Grafana, and InfluxDB, the project offers deep insights into system performance, error rates, and the data itself.

## Architecture & Data Flow

The system is composed of several independent services that communicate via MQTT and HTTP requests. There are two primary workflows: the **Data Flow** and the **Control Flow**.

### Data Flow (Real-time Message Processing)
1.  **Publish:** External sensor simulators (`sensorX_publisher.py`) publish raw JSON data to specific source topics (e.g., `/sensor1`) on an MQTT broker.
2.  **Ingest:** The core FastAPI application runs a background `MQTTClient` (`mqtt_manager.py`) which is subscribed to these source topics.
3.  **Validate:** Upon receiving a message, the `MQTTClient` dynamically loads the corresponding JSON validation schema (defined in `config.json`). It uses Pandera to validate the data.
4.  **Republish:**
    - If validation is **successful**, the original message is republished to a "validated" topic (e.g., `/sensor1/validated`).
    - If validation **fails**, a detailed error report is generated and republished to a "failed" topic (e.g., `/sensor1/failed`).
5.  **Store & Monitor:**
    - The `MQTTClient` writes every processed message (both valid and failed) to the **InfluxDB** database for persistent storage.
    - It also increments **Prometheus** counters, labeling them with status (`validated`/`failed`), sensor ID, and error type.
6.  **Visualize:**
    - The **Web Dashboard** (`dashboard.html`) connects directly to the broker, subscribing to the "validated" and "failed" topics to display a live feed of messages.
    - **Grafana** connects to both Prometheus and InfluxDB to display long-term metrics and historical data on its own dashboard.

### Control Flow (Dynamic Configuration)
1.  **User Action:** A user interacts with the **Admin Panel** (`admin.html`) to change a setting (e.g., update a topic mapping, edit a schema).
2.  **API Request:** The Admin Panel's JavaScript sends an HTTP request (e.g., `POST`, `PUT`) to the **FastAPI backend**.
3.  **Update Config:** FastAPI handles the request, updates the central `config.json` file, and modifies schema files on the server's file system.
4.  **Restart Client:** After a configuration change, FastAPI triggers a graceful restart of the background `MQTTClient`, which re-initializes with the new settings.
5.  **Broadcast Update:** FastAPI uses a **WebSocket** connection to broadcast a `"config_updated"` message to all connected Web Dashboard clients.
6.  **Dashboard Refresh:** The Web Dashboard receives the WebSocket message and automatically re-initializes its own MQTT connection, subscribing to the new set of topics defined in the updated configuration. This ensures the dashboard always reflects the current system state without requiring a manual page refresh.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the entire application stack running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker:** You must have Docker installed on your system. You can download it from the official [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- **Docker Compose:** Docker Compose is included with modern versions of Docker Desktop. If you have an older version, you may need to install it separately.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
3.  **Run the application:**
    Use Docker Compose to build the images and start all the services in detached mode (`-d`).
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    The initial build may take a few minutes as it downloads all the necessary base images and installs Python dependencies. Subsequent starts will be much faster.

4.  **Verify that all services are running:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose ps
    ```
    You should see `fastapi_app`, `influxdb`, `prometheus`, and `grafana` listed with a status of `running` or `up`.

---

## Usage

Once all services are running, you can access the different parts of the system through your web browser:

-   **Main Application & Web Dashboard:**
    -   **URL:** `http://localhost:8000`
    -   This is the live dashboard where you can see validated and failed messages in real-time.

-   **Admin Panel:**
    -   **URL:** `http://localhost:8000/admin`
    -   Use this interface to manage MQTT settings, topic mappings, and validation schemas.

-   **Grafana (Monitoring Dashboard):**
    -   **URL:** `http://localhost:3000`
    -   **Login:** `admin` / `admin` (you will be prompted to change the password on first login).
    -   Here you can view the pre-built dashboard that visualizes data from Prometheus and InfluxDB.

-   **Prometheus:**
    -   **URL:** `http://localhost:9090`
    -   You can use the Prometheus UI to explore collected metrics and check target status (`Status` -> `Targets`).

-   **InfluxDB:**
    -   **URL:** `http://localhost:8086`
    -   You can use the InfluxDB UI to explore the raw data stored in the `mqtt_data` bucket. The credentials are set in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
        - **Username:** `my-user`
        - **Password:** `my-password`
        - **Organization:** `my-org`
        - **Bucket:** `mqtt_data`

### Running the Sensor Publishers
To generate data, you need to run the sensor publisher scripts. Since the application is running inside Docker, the publishers need to be run on your **host machine** (your own computer) so they can send data to the public MQTT broker, which the Docker container can then access.

Open three separate terminals on your host machine and run the following commands, one in each terminal:

```bash
# Terminal 1
python sensors/sensor1_publisher.py
```

```bash
# Terminal 2
python sensors/sensor2_publisher.py
```

```bash
# Terminal 3
python sensors/sensor3_publisher.py
```
