# Great Expectations (GX)

## 1. What is Great Expectations?

Great Expectations (GX) is a leading open-source Python framework for data quality. Its core mission is to help data teams eliminate pipeline debt through data testing, documentation, and profiling. Think of it as unit testing for your data.

GX is built around a simple, powerful idea: making implicit assumptions about your data explicit. It does this through three core concepts:

- **Expectations**: Declarative, human-readable assertions about your data. These are the "tests" themselves.  
  - Example: `expect_column_values_to_not_be_null(column="user_id")`  
  - Example: `expect_column_values_to_be_between(column="order_amount", min_value=0)`

- **Validations**: The process of running a suite of Expectations against a batch of your data to check if it meets your quality standards.

- **Data Docs**: Human-readable documentation and data quality reports automatically generated from your Validation Results.

As a Python library, GX integrates seamlessly into data pipelines, CI/CD workflows, and data science notebooks, providing a robust foundation for building reliable data products.

## 2. Introducing GX Cloud: The Managed Data Quality Platform

**GX Cloud** is the fully managed, enterprise-grade SaaS platform that builds upon the power of the open-source framework.

### Key Advantages:
- **Centralized Collaboration**: A single source of truth for all data quality rules and results.
- **UI-Driven Workflows**: Intuitive web interface to manage Expectations and Validations.
- **Powerful Automation**: Schedule checks, configure alerts, and detect anomalies.
- **ExpectAI**: AI-powered feature that auto-generates high-value Expectations based on your data.

## 3. The GX Cloud Workflow

A typical workflow in GX Cloud involves:

1. **Connect to Data**: Securely connect to your source (e.g., PostgreSQL, Snowflake).
2. **Create a Data Asset**: Select tables/views to monitor.
3. **Define Expectations**:
   - Manually via UI
   - Automatically with anomaly detection
   - Using **ExpectAI** for AI-recommended tests
4. **Validate Your Data**: Run checks manually, on a schedule, or via orchestrators like Airflow.
5. **Review & Share**: Analyze results in dashboards, and share links with your team.

## 4. Deployment Patterns

| Pattern        | How It Works                                                                                     | When to Use It                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fully-Hosted   | GX Cloud connects to your data via a secure, read-only cloud connection.                         | Quick setup; ideal for open environments.                                      |
| Agent-Enabled  | You run a GX Agent in your environment; data stays private.                                       | For strict security policies; control stays internal.                          |
| Read-Only      | You run validations locally with the open-source GX lib; only metadata is sent to GX Cloud.      | For advanced users who need full control and only want to use GX Cloud for UI. |

## 5. Connecting to Data Sources

GX Cloud offers an easy UI to connect to sources like **Databricks**, **PostgreSQL**, **Redshift**, and **Snowflake**.

### Best Practices:
- **Use a Dedicated User**: With read-only permissions.
- **Navigate to**: `Data Assets > New Data Source` in the UI.
- **Provide Connection String**: Include host, port, username, password, and DB name.
- **Create Assets**: Select tables to monitor and start testing.

## 6. Programmatic Usage with Python

Interact with GX Cloud using the `great_expectations` Python library.

### Step 1: Install the Library

```bash
pip install great_expectations
````

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

```bash
export GX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN="<YOUR_GX_CLOUD_TOKEN>"
export GX_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION_ID="<YOUR_GX_CLOUD_ORG_ID>"
```

### Step 3: Python Script Example

```python
import great_expectations as gx
import great_expectations.expectations as gxe

# 1. Get GX Cloud context
context = gx.get_context(mode="cloud")

# 2. Load data (example: read from remote CSV using pandas source)
batch = context.data_sources.pandas_default.read_csv(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/great-expectations/gx_tutorials/main/data/yellow_tripdata_sample_2019-01.csv"
)

# 3. Create Expectation Suite
suite = gx.ExpectationSuite(name="my_taxi_data_quality_suite")

# 4. Add Expectations
suite.add_expectation(gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToNotBeNull(column="pickup_datetime"))
suite.add_expectation(
    gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToBeBetween(column="passenger_count", min_value=1, max_value=6)
)

# 5. Run Validation
results = batch.validate(suite)

# 6. Review results
print(results.describe())
```

Validation results will appear in the GX Cloud UI for review and collaboration.

## 7. Key Management Features: Metrics, Schedules, and Alerts

* **Metrics & Profiling**: Get min, max, null %, and other key stats per column â€” even before writing tests.
* **Validations & Schedules**:

  * Trigger validations manually or on a schedule (default: every 24 hours).
  * Timeline graphs show history and trends.
* **Alerts & Notifications**:

  * Get notified via email when validations fail.
  * Get ExpectAI alerts for new recommended tests.
  * Configure alerts per user and per asset for relevance.
